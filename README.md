# CS50 Harvard Course: Introduction to AI

## Project Description

This GitHub repository serves as a learning journal for the CS50 Harvard Course on Introduction to AI. It contains the code, notes, and resources related to the course, as well as any personal projects or exercises undertaken during the learning process.

The primary goal of this project is to document and track the progress made in learning various concepts and techniques in the field of Artificial Intelligence. The course covers a wide range of topics, including search algorithms, knowledge representation, machine learning, neural networks, and more. By maintaining this repository, you can monitor your progress, revisit concepts, and showcase your work to others.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `lectures`: This directory contains the lecture materials provided by the CS50 course, including slide decks, videos, and any supplementary resources.
- `exercises`: Here, you can find the exercise solutions and code implemented during the course. Each exercise may be further categorized into its respective topic.
- `projects`: This directory holds the projects assigned as part of the course. Each project has its own subdirectory with the necessary code, documentation, and any additional resources.
- `notes`: Any personal notes taken during the lectures or while studying the course materials can be stored in this directory. You can create separate Markdown or text files for each topic or concept.
